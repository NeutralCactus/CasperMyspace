						<tr>
							<th colspan="2">Casper Jayce's Psychology</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="left-column"><b>Personality</b></td>
							
							<td class="right-column">Casper is a very closed off person. He doesn't have many friends, and the ones he does have, he's more of a bystander. He lets himself be pushed around, and doesn't try to escape unhealthy relationship dynamics because he believes there's really no other options for him. He likes to retreat to fantasy and sci-fi worlds through books, one of the many ways he tries to escape reality. Extremely non-confrontational and often quiet. A yes-man, by most people's assessment.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="left-column"><b>Hobbies</b></td>
							
							<td class="right-column">Generally, Cass spends most of his time reading. Usually indoors, he can spend a whole day cooped up reading a book front to back. He doesn't bother himself with talking to other people unless it's about books, he's usually getting talked over anyways. He does occasionally write his own stuff but it never gets past the first draft before he quits. Sometimes they draw, but it's hard as they have very few art supplies, and resort to shoplifting in the rare cases they feel like being artistic. He gets his books from the library, where he also spends a lot of his time on days where it's not too hot to bike there.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="left-column"><b>Likes</b></td>
							
							<td class="right-column">Cass has always been a big fan of cats, he had one growing up. Casper also likes anything sweet, especially berries and chocolate. They like tight spaces a lot, which some people find to be strange. He also likes collecting dead bugs and putting them in jars to display. Many people find that strange, but he doesn't mind. His favorite genres of books to read are sci-fi and fantasy. He especially likes the works of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, for their weird tangents and interesting writing style.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="left-column"><b>Dislikes</b></td>
							
							<td class="right-column">Cass really doesn't like spicy food. Or most foods that aren't very plain. He's often called a picky eater for that reason. Cass is also not too fond of dogs, though he isn't afraid of them like most people think. He just doesn't like them. They also tend to stay away from physical exercise as much as possible, growing up with asthma made it hard to participate and now he's too worried about failing to even try. He also doesn't like reading romance novels, but he couldn't tell you why.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="left-column"><b>Fears</b></td>
							
							<td class="right-column">Cass is afraid of large bodies of water - specifically, rivers, lakes, and oceans. Pools are just fine, so long as they're filtered and such, but anything else is terrifying and he refuses to go in. Cass is also extremely fearful of himself in a lot of ways. He has a lot of intrusive violent thoughts that make him scared for his own and others' safety. That's part of the reason he doesn't hang around many people. He's not scared of the dark, but he's scared of being alone in the dark in a large empty space. Say, the woods, for a completely irrelevant example.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="left-column"><b>Mental Conditions</b></td>
							
							<td class="right-column">ASD (diagnosed)<br>Mostly impacts his social skills. His inability to communicate effectively as well as read social cues stems from this. Also his tendency to observe his surroundings and recall specifics about them are because of this.<br>OCD (undiagnosed)<br>His obsessiveness and intrusive thoughts come from undiagnosed OCD. His compulsions are very easy to hide, most people just attribute them to being 'bad habits'. These include picking at his skin a lot, tapping fingers in strange patterns, or blinking very rapidly in a short period of time.<br>Depression (undiagnosed)<br>He'll sometimes go through depressive periods where he is unable to do almost anything. He also occasionally gets more unsavory thoughts. (I'm sure you can guess what variety I'm talking about)<br>Anxiety (diagnosed)<br>Anxiety is the only thing Casper is currently medicated for. He is taking Fluoxetine Hydrochloride, commonly known as Prozac, which is a SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and also serves as an antidepressant, which is nice. His anxiety affects him in many ways, most notably he is extremely worried about losing everyone around him all the time, as well as being unable to handle public speaking.</td>

				<div class="subheader">Casper Jayce's Blurbs</div>
				
				
				<!-- Put your character's remaining information here! -->
				<p class="bheader">Criminal Record:</p>
				<p class="blurb">A few shoplifting charges, carjacking</p>
				
				<p class="bheader">Strengths:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Observational skills. Cass has been told he often notices things people don't. How useful this is, he doesn't know, as this doesn't apply to people, rather the environment around him. (He often notices when items are out of place, or when a smell/taste has changed slightly.)</li>
					<li>Logical thinking. Casper has always been exceptionally good at things like mathematics and science. He doesn't put them to use very often, since he mostly reads, but he is good at thinking through things very objectively. Some people call him a robot for it, but he's good at solving riddles and puzzles.</li>
					<li>Memory. Casper remembers things very well. He can save and recall information pretty quickly. He doesn't often forget a face or a name. He can recall small details about people that others might forget.</li>			  
				</ol>
				
				<p class="bheader">Weaknesses:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Human interaction. Casper isn't very good with other people. He doesn't know how to read them or interact with them a lot of the time, and often says or does the wrong thing. He's not good at "reading the room".</li>
					<li>Physical activity. Casper is very weak. He's not good at sports or physical labor of any kind. He's also asthmatic which does not help one bit. In short, he's always picked last for sports teams in school. (If he's not already sitting out with a doctor's note) Anything more physically taxing than the 5 minute bike ride to the library is a no-go.</li>
					<li>Lying. Casper is a very bad liar. If he's ever in a situation where he has to lie, he will try to deflect or escape, using lying as a last resort. He's just… so bad at it. It's very obvious. Firstly, his tone of voice is very unsure when he lies. He also blinks a lot and fidgets with his hands (more than the normal amount) and taps his feet. Most people who know him for five minutes are able to pick up on his lying tells just from context clues alone, which is saying something.</li>			  
				</ol>
				
				<p class="bheader">Fatal Flaw:</p>
				<p class="blurb">Casper doesn't know when to stop once he's hooked. Whether it's reading a book, shoplifting, or an argument, once he's in, he's in. Some things, like his hobby of writing, aren't commitments. But when he commits to something, he can't stop. He's lost a lot of friends by refusing to drop an argument. He's unable to stop himself from shoplifting any time he goes anywhere, even though he isn't often caught. (Which is good, because when he is caught, he can't lie.) If something piques his interest, he'll pursue it to its very end, often to the detriment of his own health. Both physical and mental.</p>
				
				<p class="bheader">Backstory:</p>
				<p class="blurb"><b style="color: #468646;">TW: (TWs Here)</b></p>				
				<p class="blurb">Casper grew up middle class in Springfield, Oregon. He's lived in the same house all his life, with their mom, dad, and cat named Slinky. It's a five minute bike ride to the local library, where he spent a lot of time growing up, as his mom worked there. His dad was almost always out of town on business trips.<br>When Casper was 10, his mother got a new job at the edge of the city and suddenly he was alone most of the time when he wasn't at school. He took the bus to and from school, having his own house key, and he liked the independence. After long enough it took its toll, and with Casper's limited social skills, he found himself hanging around with people who didn't treat him the best. He picked up the bad habit of shoplifting when he was only 12, and from there things took a downward turn. Most of his middle school years were spent in the same routine. On weekdays, he'd wake up, go to school after being sent off by his mother (his father was already at work), come back on the bus, spend an hour with his 'friends' around the neighborhood, do some homework, and sleep.<br>His time around the neighborhood was solely dedicated to trying to prove himself to his 'friends'. He'd shoplift snacks, help them TP and egg houses of people they didn't like, and ding-dong-ditch anyone they felt like annoying. On the weekends he'd do a lot of the same, or he'd stay in and read. If he didn't have anything to read, he'd go to the library and grab something, and then return to his normal schedule. Usually he'd stop by some store on the way back from the library to pick up a snack or two, without paying, of course.<br>No one really suspected him. The neighborhood he lived in was very closely knit, and almost everyone knew Casper's mother from her days at the library. Casper wasn't caught for shoplifting until he was 14. After that, he was caught a few more times, but it only taught him to be more careful.<br>He'd never done anything particularly bad until his 16th birthday, when under pressure from some of his 'friends', he'd helped them carjack his neighbor's fancy new sports car and joined them for a joyride. It was supposed to be a celebration of his birthday, but they were eventually caught, and everyone scattered. They left Casper to defend himself and he was subsequently charged with the carjacking crime, only saving himself from further punishment by taking the plea deal to go to Lacuna Camp.</p>
